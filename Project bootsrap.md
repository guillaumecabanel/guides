c. Set your client account as **Owner** of this _group_

d. Create a repository

e. Invite all your team to this _group_



## 2. Production Server

a. Create an account for your client on [Clever Cloud](https://clever-cloud.com)

c. Ask him to invite you as **Admin**

d. You can now invite your team to this _organisation_

e. Ask your client to give you access to the configuration to the DNS of his domain name



## 3. Kanban 

a. Create a _team_ on [Trello](https://trello.com)
